<h3> About </h3>
<p>
I am an astronomer/astrophysicist at Northwestern University. 
Specifically, I work at CIERA, in prof.&nbsp;Claude-Andr&eacute; Faucher-Gigu&egrave;re's 
research group. 
Before that, I worked in prof.&nbsp;Joop Schaye's group at Leiden Observatory, 
where I obtained my PhD.
I study how diffuse gas around galaxies 
drives/affects the formation and evolution of those galaxies.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not doing research, I enjoy climbing/bouldering, board games, puzzles, 
and hiking when I get the chance.

<h3> Research </h3>
<p> The Universe contains galaxies of many shapes and sizes, including our own Milky Way.
These galaxies are surrounded haloes of gas and dark matter, and those haloes are in 
turn connected by sheets and filaments of dark matter and gas which form the
&lsquo;cosmic web&rsquo;. 
The gas in the cosmic web and galaxy haloes is diffuse, and therefore often difficult
to observe. However, it plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies.
The gas in galaxy haloes, and ultimately in the cosmic web, 
is needed to fuel star formation within galaxies. Though galaxies contain gas as well as
stars, this gas is insufficient to maintain star formation as long as we know they must.
</p> 
<p>
The galaxies also affect the gas in their haloes: when stars form in a galaxy,
they eventually die. Massive stars, which are also relatively short-lived,
can explode as supernovae. These supernova explosions can generate outflows, where gas
is ejected from the galaxy into its halo. These outflows may even escape the halo 
altogether and join the cosmic web, possibly sweeping up some of the halo gas on the way.
</p>
<p>
Besides stars, supermassive black holes that live at the centers of galaxies 
like our own Milky Way can also drive outflows. This can happen when gas falls into this
black hole. Although nothing can escape from inside a black hole, the extreme forces 
<em>near</em> a black hole can release a lot of energy from the infalling gas.
This energy release can drive outflows out of the galaxy, and perhaps even its halo.
</p>
<p>
I use simulations of dark matter, gas, stars and black holes 
(currently FIRE, previously EAGLE) to study this diffuse gas around and between galaxies.
Some of this gas has been detected in observations, but it has been especially hard to 
find the hotter gas around 
roughly Milky-Way-mass galaxies and in the cosmic web.
My research has focused on possible ways to detect this gas
(e.g., with planned and proposed future instruments), 
and on comparing simulation predictions to some observations we currently do have.
